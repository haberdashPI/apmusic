# Introduction

This project archives the results for the following, in-submission publication:

Inducing musical-interval learning by combining task practice with periods of
stimulus exposure alone

## Abstract

A key component of musical proficiency is the ability to discriminate between
and identify musical intervals, fixed ratios between pitches. Acquiring these
skills requires training, but little is known about how to best arrange the
trials within a training session. To address this issue, learning on a
musical-interval comparison task was evaluated for two four-day training
regimens that employed equal numbers of stimulus presentations per day.  A
regimen of continuous practice yielded no learning, but a regimen that combined
practice and stimulus exposure alone generated clear improvement. Learning in
the practice-plus-exposure regimen was due to the combination of the two
experiences, because two control groups who received only either the practice
or the exposure from that regimen did not learn. Post-test performance
suggested that comparison learning generalized to an untrained stimulus type
and an untrained musical-interval identification task. NaÃ¯ve comparison
performance, but not learning, was better for larger pitch-ratio differences
and for individuals with more musical experience. The reported benefits of the
practice-plus-exposure regimen mirror outcomes for fine-grained discrimination
and speech tasks, suggesting a general learning principle is involved. In
practical terms, it appears that combining practice and stimulus exposure alone
is a particularly effective configuration for improving musical-interval
perception.

# Installation

Once you have downloaded this project, to setup the development environment
will need to install [Anaconda Python 2.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
Once you're finished with the installation, run the following commands on the
command line (replacing `[project directory]` with the location of the folder
containing the downloaded project).

```sh
cd [project directory]
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate apmusic_2018_07_24
```

> In windows these command can be run on the command line that is 
> installed with Anaconda. You will also need to replace the last line
> as follows:
> ```sh
> activate apmusic_2017_12_03_02
> ```

This setup will take some time to run on your machine as various python and R
software packages are installed.

> **Troubleshooting**: If there is any issue with creating
> the above environment, you can attempt to reconstruct it 
> from the `create_environment.sh` script.

## Mac OS X - Make sure you have command-line developer tools installed

On Mac OS X, if you plan to re-run any of the python preprocessing steps, you
will need to make sure you have the [command-line developer tools
installed](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).

# Usage

Once installed, to run the analyses or re-create a figure you will need to have
an open programming environment ready. If you haven't closed the window you
opened during "Installation", you can use that, otherwise, re-open the command
line and run the following

```sh
cd [project directory]
source activate apmusic_2018_07_24
```

> Again, in Windows these command can be run on the command line that is 
> installed with Anaconda and you will need to replace the last line
> with `activate apmusic_2018_07_24` (no `source`).

Each figure panel from the paper generally has at least two corresponding
files. They are either python or R source files, and they re-create the figure
pdf and run the corresponding analyses, respectively. These files are located
under the `plots` and `analyses` subfolders. There are some figures with
auxiliary analyses (e.g. figure 2A has a secondary analysis by foil instead of
regimen), which are included as separate scripts. All scripts associated with a
figure include that figure name as a prefix of the filename.
 
To run any of these files, call either `Rscript` or `python` (as appropriate for
the file type) from the same command line you used above.

For example, to re-run the analysis corresponding to Figure 1A you can call the
following from the command line.

```sh
python analyses/fig1A.py
```

And to re-create Figure 1A's pdf:

```sh
Rscript plots/fig1A.R
```

> Yet again, Windows will differ: use `\` instead of `/` in your directory names.

## Recreating the preprocessed data

The scripts for each figure and analysis load some preprocessed data. All
preprocessed data files are listed in `preprocessing/files.txt`. If you want to
recreate one of these files you can do so by finding the script with the same
name prefix as the file.

For example, the preprocessed data file
`preprocessing/data/discrim_2017-12-31.csv` can be recreated (with a new date
suffix) by calling

```sh
Rscript preprocessing/discrim.R
```

All preprocessed files are stored under the `preprocessing/data` subfolder,
while the `data` subfolder contains the original data, as collected during the
experiment.

**WARNING**: some of the preprocessing steps can be time consuming to run. 

To start all analyses over from scratch, delete all of the preprocessing
data files under the `preprocessing/data` directory. Then, rerun the
preprocessing scripts in the following order

1. Aggregate discrimination data - `Rscript preprocessing/discrim.R`
2. Aggregate classification data - `Rscript preprocessing/class.R`
3. Multi-level model fitting - `python preprocessing/multi_level_sample.py` 
4. Multi-level model fitting with musical experience - `python
   preprocessing/music_multi_level_sample.py` 
5. Each figure's preprocessing scripts - `python preprocessing/fig1A.py`, then
   `python preprocessing/fig1B.py`, etc...

Steps 2 and 3 will be the most time consuming (e.g. ~30 minutes on a 2015
MacBook Air).

If you re-process any data you will have to update the file name listed in
`preprocessing/files.txt` so that any scripts relying on this data will use the
newly created files. To be absolutely certain you are using newly created files
you can delete the old scripts (or move them to another folder).

## Editing the scripts

You can use a language specific editor:

* For R - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* For python - [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/index.html)

You can also use any decent code editor to edit both file types (listed in
approximate order from fastest to slowest to learn).

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)

These generic editors sometimes require you to install specific plugins to read
R and python files.

# Regimen Abbreviations

The training regimens, as described in the paper have been given abbreviations
in the analysis: AP (Practice+Exposure), LA (All-Practice), SA
(Practice+Silence),and P (Exposure+Silence).

# Comparison to Published Figures and Statistics
The resulting pdfs from the analysis were imported into Adobe Illustrator and
the aesthetics modified for improved legibility and consistency across plots.
Thus the published figures will differ somewhat from those produced by these
scripts: however, the actual data and reported statistics as represented in the
final paper should remain *unchanged*. Small variations in model fits and the
resulting statistics will occur due variations in  MCMC sampling.
